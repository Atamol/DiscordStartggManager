# DiscordStartggManager

**DiscordStartggManager** is a Discord bot designed to make running tournaments on [start.gg](https://start.gg/) smoother and more efficient.  
This project‚Äôs made with the Super Smash Bros. series in mind.

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| üéÆ Match Notifications | When a match station is assigned on start.gg, the bot sends a mention-tagged match card in Discord. |
| üîò Score Input | Allows you to submit match scores directly from Discord using buttons. |
| ‚úÖ Match Completion | Once scores are submitted, the match is marked as complete and locked from further edits. |
| üñ•Ô∏è Supports Reassignment | If a station number changes, the bot automatically updates the existing post in Discord. |
| üë• Role Assignment for Participants | Quickly add or remove a role for all participants (helps avoid pinging non-participants with `@everyone`). |

# How to Set It Up

### ‚ùó Currently, this bot is **not** hosted by the developer

If you want to use it right now, you‚Äôll need to host it yourself.  

> I‚Äôm working on making it easier to set up and use ‚Äî and I‚Äôm looking for collaborators to help improve it!  

If hosting it yourself sounds tricky, I also offer one-on-one setup support. Feel free to reach out via [X (Twitter)](https://x.com/Atamol_ssb).

# ‚ùó Looking for Collaborators
This project is being developed solo, step-by-step, with the goal of making it ready for public use.  
Future plans include adding a web-based setup interface and optimizing it for large-scale tournament operations.  
Bug reports, feature suggestions, and any other kind of contribution are welcome!  
Pull requests from developers are also greatly appreciated.
